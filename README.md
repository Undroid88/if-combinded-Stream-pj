## Welcome to my project Quiz! 

## 🧠 Introduction:
In my role as an Administrator, a large part of my work involves supporting colleagues, organising information, and helping ensure that our internal procedures are followed correctly. Many of these procedures relate to areas such as data protection, communication standards, reporting expectations, and general workplace conduct. Because staff work across different teams and often handle a variety of tasks, it is important that everyone has a clear and consistent understanding of the organisation’s policies. When this knowledge isn’t consistent, it can lead to mistakes, delays, or confusion. For this reason, tools that help reinforce organisational understanding are valuable.

This project presents a simple organisational knowledge quiz designed to support staff learning in a straightforward and accessible way. The quiz allows employees to check their understanding of key workplace topics through multiple‑choice questions and receive instant feedback. It can be used for onboarding, refresher training, or general confidence‑building. I have created for this assignment a version which is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as mentioned in the assignment brief. This means it is a basic but fully functional first version containing only the essential features needed to demonstrate how the quiz works. 

The development of this quiz also demonstrates real programming practices, including the use of Python and Streamlit, version control with GitHub, object‑oriented design, CSV data storage, input validation, exception handling, and basic unit testing. Overall, the project shows how a small digital tool can support organisational learning while applying modern development techniques.

## 🎨 Design Section:
The graphical user interface for the quiz was designed using Figma to plan the layout, user flow, and visual structure before coding began. The design focuses on simplicity and accessibility to ensure staff members can complete the quiz without technical difficulty.

Screens included in the Figma design:

* Welcome Screen/ Main menu: User enters the 'Begin Quiz' Button.
* Quiz Screen: Displays one multiple‑choice question at a time with radio‑button options.
* Results Screen: Shows the final score and provides an option to download or export results.

### Here is my screenshot of the Main Menu screen:

#### Above you can see that the Main Menu doesnt ask for a name rather just asks to click the button to begin the quiz
 * this was made as i thought as the app required a name, I thought of other ways i can create/design my quiz and one was through making it anonymous
 * Therefore, my figma design quiz didnt ask for a name to begin a quiz just like how an anonymous form wouldnt require one

I chose to do this because i thought this would also help people answer the questions comfortably as they wouldnt need to worry if people knew what answers they got as it would be anonymous - although again this was made just for people to learn more about their role in a comfortable safe environment.
