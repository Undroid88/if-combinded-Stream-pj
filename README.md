## Welcome to my project Quiz! 

## 🧠 Introduction:
In my role as an Administrator, a large part of my work involves supporting colleagues, organising information, and helping ensure that our internal procedures are followed correctly. Many of these procedures relate to areas such as data protection, communication standards, reporting expectations, and general workplace conduct. Because staff work across different teams and often handle a variety of tasks, it is important that everyone has a clear and consistent understanding of the organisation’s policies. When this knowledge isn’t consistent, it can lead to mistakes, delays, or confusion. For this reason, tools that help reinforce organisational understanding are valuable.

This project presents a simple organisational knowledge quiz designed to support staff learning in a straightforward and accessible way. The quiz allows employees to check their understanding of key workplace topics through multiple‑choice questions and receive instant feedback. It can be used for onboarding, refresher training, or general confidence‑building. The version created for this assignment is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This means it is a basic but fully functional first version containing only the essential features needed to demonstrate how the quiz works. The purpose of an MVP is not to be perfect, but to show the core idea clearly and allow room for future improvement.

The development of this quiz also demonstrates real programming practices, including the use of Python and Streamlit, version control with GitHub, object‑oriented design, CSV data storage, input validation, exception handling, and basic unit testing. Overall, the project shows how a small digital tool can support organisational learning while applying modern development techniques

## 🎨 Design Section:
The graphical user interface for the quiz was designed using Figma to plan the layout, user flow, and visual structure before coding began. The design focuses on simplicity and accessibility to ensure staff members can complete the quiz without technical difficulty.

Screens included in the Figma design:

* Welcome Screen/ Main menu: User enters the 'Begin Quiz' Button.
* Quiz Screen: Displays one multiple‑choice question at a time with radio‑button options.
* Results Screen: Shows the final score and provides an option to download or export results.
